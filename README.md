### Hi! I'm Irving ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my Github!

:computer:
I'm a computer engineer who likes to create and learn new stuffs all the time, I love to learn by myself and on my jobs I'm looking for the same, but that dose not mean that I hate the teamwork, quite the opposite, I'm always believe more heads gets better ideas and solutions than just one.

:man_cartwheeling:
I'm a passionate for sports and physicall activity, mainly gymnastics, I'm a gymnastics coach where I have found some functions, components, etcetera that makes my gymnasts get the target we look for.
